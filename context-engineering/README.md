## Introduction
Context engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and managing the information (context) provided to AI models to optimize their outputs. It is crucial for getting accurate, relevant, and safe responses from large language models (LLMs).

---

## Why Context Matters
- LLMs have limited context windows (e.g., 8k, 32k tokens)
- Relevant context improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations
- Good context enables multi-turn conversations and task continuity

---

## Techniques
- **Prompt design and chaining:** Structure prompts to guide model behavior
- **Context window management:** Fit the most relevant info within the modelâ€™s token limit
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Dynamically fetch relevant documents
- **Memory and state management:** Track conversation or workflow state

---

## Prompt Engineering
- Use system messages to set behavior
- Provide examples (few-shot learning)
- Use delimiters to separate context
- Be explicit about instructions

### Example Prompt
```
System: You are a helpful assistant.
User: Summarize the following text...
```

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge sources (databases, search engines) to provide up-to-date, relevant information.

### Example RAG Workflow
1. User asks a question
2. System retrieves relevant documents
3. LLM generates answer using retrieved context

---

## Memory and State
- Store conversation history
- Use embeddings to recall relevant past interactions
- Enable long-term personalization

---

## Examples
- Providing relevant background in prompts
- Using system messages to guide model behavior
- Chaining prompts for multi-step tasks

---

## Best Practices
- Keep context concise and relevant
- Use retrieval to supplement model knowledge
- Monitor for context drift
- Test with real user queries

---

## Challenges
- Token limits
- Context drift (irrelevant info accumulates)
- Privacy and data security
- Real-time retrieval latency

## FAQ
**Q: How do I keep context relevant?**
A: Use retrieval and summarization to focus on what matters.

**Q: Can LLMs remember previous conversations?**
A: Only within the context window, unless you implement external memory.

**Q: What is context drift?**
A: When irrelevant or outdated info accumulates in the context.
