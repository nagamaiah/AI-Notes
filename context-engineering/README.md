## What is Context Engineering?
Context engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and managing the information (context) provided to AI models to optimize their outputs.

### Techniques
- Prompt design and chaining
- Context window management
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Memory and state management

### Examples
- Providing relevant background in prompts
- Using system messages to guide model behavior
