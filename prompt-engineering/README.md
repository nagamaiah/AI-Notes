## Introduction
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to guide AI models toward desired outputs. It is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs).

---

## Why Prompt Engineering?
- LLMs are sensitive to prompt phrasing
- Good prompts yield more accurate and relevant results
- Enables control over model behavior

---

## Prompt Types
- **Instructional:** Direct the model to perform a task
- **Conversational:** Multi-turn dialogue
- **Contextual:** Provide background information
- **Few-shot:** Include examples for better results

---

## Best Practices
- Be explicit and clear
- Provide context and examples
- Use system and user roles
- Test and iterate
- Limit ambiguity

---

## Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning
- **Zero-shot:** No examples, just instructions
- **Few-shot:** Provide 1-5 examples to guide the model

### Example
```
Translate English to French:
English: Hello
French: Bonjour
English: Goodbye
French:
```

---

## Prompt Chaining
- Break complex tasks into multiple steps
- Chain outputs from one prompt as input to the next

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Overly vague prompts
- Too much or too little context
- Ignoring model limitations

---

## Examples
### Summarization
```
You are a helpful assistant. Summarize the following text:
...
```

### Code Generation
```
# Write a Python function to reverse a string
```

### Role Prompting
```
System: You are a math tutor.
User: Explain the Pythagorean theorem.
```

## FAQ
**Q: How do I know if my prompt is good?**
A: Test with multiple inputs and refine based on results.

**Q: Can I automate prompt generation?**
A: Yes, with prompt templates and chaining tools.

**Q: What is prompt injection?**
A: When a user manipulates the prompt to change model behavior; sanitize inputs to prevent this.
